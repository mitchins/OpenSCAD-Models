# LEGO-to-Nano Block Build Plate Adapter

This project is an OpenSCAD design for a customizable 3D-printed build plate adapter. It connects to LEGO blocks on the bottom and supports nano or mini blocks on the top.

## Features
- **Customizable Dimensions**: Adjust the width and length to fit various LEGO plate sizes.
- **Dual Compatibility**: 
  - **Bottom**: LEGO-compatible studs for secure attachment to LEGO plates or blocks.
  - **Top**: Pegs for nano/mini blocks, compatible with various generic brands.

## Parameters
Modify the following parameters in the OpenSCAD file for customization:
- `adapter_width`: Width of the adapter in LEGO studs.
- `adapter_length`: Length of the adapter in LEGO studs.
- `peg_diameter`: Diameter of the nano block pegs.
- `peg_height`: Height of the nano block pegs.

## Usage
1. Adjust parameters in `OpenSCAD` to your preferred dimensions.
2. Export to STL for 3D printing.
3. Print and snap onto a LEGO plate, then add your nano/mini blocks on top!
